For RCM-comm_v1 board:
* Move HAND1 so it doesn't conflict with edge of Matchport board (done)
* Specify proper spacer on 32x2 connector to get right height profile (SAMTEC ESQ-116-13-G-D) (done)
* Create footprint for new Ethernet cable connector (DigiKey WM4170-ND, Molex 70555-0007) and put into place (done)
* Indicate on silk screen pin 1 of Matchport - maybe where antenna comes out? (done)
* Create proper BOM (done)
* Eliminate the PTH LEDs. (done)

RCM-comm_V2 board: Started 01/23/2015
New verion based on RCM-comm_v1, but with xPico WiFi/xPico Ethernet radio rather than Matchport
* Create xPico WiFi footprint (done)
* Wire up xPico in place of macthport
* Check magnetics as per Lantronix datasheet
* Add in switches
* Check that LEDs are connected and labed properly
* Add in CP header from xPico
* Connect up SPI from xPico WiFi to BFin SPI with solder jumpers
* Add in buttons

RCM-Comm_v3 BPS 05/30/2016
* Added .125 dia holes in new locations for plastic mounting screws
* Removed two previous .125 plated through holes

RCM-Comm_v4 BPS 12/22/2018
* Use xPico 240 radio
* Remove all un-used circuitry (USB connector, second serial port, SPI port, etc.)
* Need to figure out proper hardware for screwing down end of radio. 

(xPico_200_Series_EVK J2 connector use - confirmed working)
J2 pin  Name    RCM-Bfin J4 pin
27      TX      4  (RX0)
28      RTS     17 (RTS/PH0)
29      RX      3  (TX0)
30      CTS     23 (CTS/PH6)
35      GND     2  (GND)

(xPico 240 setup)
* Use soft AP to log in and configure WLAN profile so that xPico can connect to local WiFi
* Once that's working log in (username "admin" password "PASSWORD") with the IP address it gets from WiFi network's DHCP server
* Set up Tunnel 1: Accept: Mode: Always
* Tunnel 1: Accept: Local Port: 10001
* Line 1: Configuration: Baud Rate: Custom: 2500000
* Line 1: Configuration: Interface: RS232
* Line 1: Configuration: State: Enabled
* Line 1: Configuration: Protocol: Tunnel
* Line 1: Configuration: Flow Control: Hardware
